        <h2>Business Owner/Web Developer Student</h2>

        <p>I am a local business owner here in Raleigh and love what I do!  Over the past couple years I have been wanting to further my education in the field of Web Development as it is something that has always interested me.  This is my second full semester at WakeTech and this May will be my third year as a business owner.</p>

        <p>I have lived in Raleigh, N.C. since 2015 but am originally from the area.  By the end of this Summer, my goal is to have successfully obtained my Front End Web Developers certificate but I won't stop there!</p>
